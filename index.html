            Starting from a simple point of view: " All Buildings Are Interesting", this article explores how people view architecture in their everyday lives. The author's emphasis on "interesting" is not to judge the quality or artistic value of the building, but to say that every building has something noteworthy. Ordinary buildings are also valuable and interesting. This idea has sparked discussion among readers. In the comments, many people listed buildings that they considered "not interesting", such as ordinary university buildings, ranch houses, Applebee's restaurants, etc. Ironically, these people took the time to search, download and share photos of these buildings, proving that the buildings themselves were interesting enough.

            The first author refers to this neglect of everyday architecture as "building blindness," similar to "tree blindness" in botany. Just as tree blindness prevents people from truly understanding the plant world around them, architectural blindness also causes people to lose a deep connection with their surroundings. Buildings are not as systematically classified as plants, but they deserve our deep understanding. The authors point out that existing architectural classification systems, such as architectural styles or schools of architectural thought, tend to focus only on important or iconic buildings while ignoring the ordinary buildings we come into contact with every day. These categories don't account for the kinds of buildings that are common in our daily lives, such as ranch houses in the suburbs or common fast-food chains.

            Second, the author uses the ranch house as an example to show that even those buildings that are considered "boring" can be rich in interest. The article describes two ranch houses built during the same period. Although they look similar, a closer look reveals some differences in design, layout, materials, and so on. Through this comparison, the authors show how each building goes beyond the surface to reveal its unique personality and historical context. Even our perception of the "ranch house" as a building type is based on experiences and memories in our lives. Like where we've seen these houses, when they were popular, or who they were usually home to. This understanding does not come from definitions in books, but from observations and experiences in our daily lives.

            The article also explores how we subconsciously form an "architectural encyclopedia." Although we may not be architectural experts, everyone has accumulated a large amount of knowledge and impressions about architecture in their minds. We can distinguish between different types of houses and understand their function and symbolism. Even mundane buildings like fast food chains, shopping malls, or office parks have their own unique aesthetic and historical context. The author also points out that branded buildings such as McDonald's and Starbucks become part of our architectural memory through their unique design elements and iconic appearance. They are not only functional buildings, but also part of the brand image and shape our perception of architecture.

            This neglect of everyday architecture causes us to miss out on opportunities to connect with our surroundings. The author encourages us to break the shackles of "architectural blindness" and use curiosity and critical thinking to look at those seemingly ordinary buildings. In this way, we can discover the social, cultural and historical significance behind the building. This kind of in-depth observation and reflection not only enrich is our understanding of the world around us, but also helps us make deeper emotional connections in our daily lives.

            All in all, the article tells us that we need to change the way we look at architecture, reminding us that even the most mundane buildings have something to be noticed. They may represent a particular historical period, a way of life, or a cultural symbol. By paying attention to these details, we can not only broaden our understanding of architecture, but also better resonate with the environment in which we find ourselves. This article calls on us to go beyond superficial judgment, to observe, understand, and feel the everyday buildings that were once ignored, and to re-understand the world we live in.
