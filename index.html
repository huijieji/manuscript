        Kate Wagner is the creator of the viral blog McMansionHell, which roasts the world’s ugliest houses from top to bottom, all while teaching about architecture and design. Since its launch in July 2016, the blog has been featured in a wide range of publications, including the Huffington Post, Slate, Business Insider, and Paper Magazine.

    <p>This article argues that every building is inherently interesting, regardless of its perceived aesthetic value or its status within what is considered Important Architecture™. It challenges conventional architectural hierarchies by asserting that all buildings, from the celebrated to the mundane, possess unique qualities worth examining. The author begins by recounting a provocative tweet asserting that "all buildings are interesting," which sparked a lively online discussion. The discussion revealed that even those structures often dismissed as "boring," such as fast-food chains, suburban houses, or strip malls, elicited sufficient curiosity and debate to underscore their inherent intrigue.</p>

            The author introduces the concept of "building blindness," drawing an analogy to "tree blindness." Just as many people overlook the unique characteristics of individual trees, seeing them only as part of the background, most people similarly ignore the architectural details of everyday buildings. This blindness is perpetuated by the lack of a systematic approach to categorizing these buildings. Unlike plants, which benefit from a meticulous taxonomy, everyday buildings often fall outside the established frameworks of architectural classification. Traditional categories such as styles, periods, or architectural movements often fail to capture the diversity and complexity of the everyday built environment. Even vernacular architecture, which has been loosely defined to include self-built or folk structures, lacks a standardized method of classification. This gap in categorization contributes to the general public's tendency to overlook the uniqueness of these buildings.

            To illustrate the potential for interest in everyday structures, the article delves into the example of the "ranch house." Common in American suburbs, the ranch house is often dismissed as monotonous or devoid of architectural value. However, upon closer inspection, one can discern a multitude of variations in size, material, shape, and details that make each ranch house unique. This suggests that most people possess a form of an "architectural encyclopedia," shaped by cultural experiences and personal encounters with different types of buildings. People can often identify architectural types like "Cape Cods" or "McMansions" without any formal training, revealing an implicit awareness and appreciation of architectural diversity.

            The article goes on to explore why everyday architecture, such as strip malls, fast-food chains, and suburban homes, is not held in the same regard as more iconic buildings by renowned architects. The answer lies partly in the intent and design of these structures. "Capital-A Architecture," or buildings designed by famous architects, is often intended to be monumental, permanent, and ideologically significant. These buildings are usually meticulously documented, preserved, and studied, and they occupy a central place in architectural history. They are created to be timeless and are funded and maintained in ways that support their longevity.

            Typically designed to be functional, adaptable, and responsive to economic needs. These structures are built quickly, modified frequently, and often demolished when they no longer serve their purpose. Examples include fast-food chains that adapt to changing consumer preferences, office parks that undergo frequent renovations, and suburban homes that evolve to meet shifting family needs. Although these buildings are not intended to last forever, they are invaluable as cultural artifacts, revealing much about societal values, consumer behavior, and economic trends at a given moment in time.

            The article emphasizes that while "Capital-A" Architecture is thoroughly documented and studied within academic and professional circles, the task of preserving the history of everyday buildings often falls to amateur historians, enthusiasts, bloggers, and social media communities. These grassroots efforts are vital because they provide alternative perspectives and narratives that might otherwise be overlooked. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and blogs have democratized architectural appreciation, allowing people to share and celebrate the unique characteristics of everyday buildings in ways that were not possible before. This digital archiving helps ensure that these buildings, which might be subject to demolition or significant alteration, are documented and remembered.

            Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of expanding the conversation around what constitutes "architectural significance." Rather than reserving this term for grand monuments or iconic works by famous architects, it argues for a broader understanding that includes all buildings, from high-rise offices to strip malls, suburban homes, and industrial parks. This shift in perspective encourages a democratization of architectural discourse, suggesting that everyone, not just trained architects or critics, has a role in shaping our understanding of the built environment. Every person brings their unique experiences and insights, contributing to a richer, more inclusive dialogue.

            By paying closer attention to our everyday surroundings, we also begin to see how the built environment reflects larger societal issues, such as economic disparities, social justice concerns, and environmental sustainability. For instance, the proliferation of certain types of buildings—like big-box stores or luxury condos—can reveal trends in economic policy, zoning laws, and social stratification. Recognizing these patterns enables us to think critically about how we want our cities and communities to develop in the future.

        Ultimately, this article calls on readers to broaden their definition of what makes a building "interesting" and to value the stories embedded in all types of structures. It challenges the notion that only iconic, monumental, or historically significant buildings are worth studying or preserving. By looking closely at the ordinary and the everyday, we gain a deeper appreciation of the complexities and nuances of our built environment, making us more mindful participants in shaping the world around us.
